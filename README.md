# socket-practice-c




I'm trying to learn more about networking. This project is to teach myself about sockets, as well as other networking terms such as TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6 etc. I am sort of interested in lower level programming and eventually would love to become a platform engineer someday. This is just a small baby step in a fundamental piece of that.
